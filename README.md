# ðŸ“® Redbox Copilot

Redbox Copilot is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) app that uses Claude 2 to organise, categorise and summarise civil service documents. It's designed to handle a variety of administrative sources, such as letters, briefings, minutes, and speech transcripts.

- **Better retrieval**. Redbox Copilot increases organisational memory by indexing documents
- **Faster, accurate summarisation**. Redbox Copilot can summarise reports read months ago, supplement them with current work, and produce a first draft that lets civil servants focus on what they do best

# Local Dev Setup

The entire architecture runs in docker compose for local development. This includes locally hosting the app, databases, object store and orchestration. Therefore, you will need docker installed.

## First time setup

You will need to create a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env` to store your secrets, such as your Anthropic API key (ask the team for the keys). The `.env` file should not be committed to GitHub.

If you have issues with permissions, you may need to run `chmod 777 data/elastic/` to be able to write to the folder.

## To run

You can simply run:

`docker compose up` or `make run`

You'll find a series of useful `docker compose` commands already maded in [`Makefile`](./Makefile)

Any time you update code for the the repo, you'll likely need to rebuild the containers.

# Development

- Download and install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to benefit from pre-commit hooks
  - `pip install pre-commit`
  - `pre-commit install`

# Dependencies

This project uses a microservice architecture.

Each microservice runs in its own container defined by a `Dockerfile`.

For every microservice that we have written in python we define its dependencies using https://python-poetry.org/.

This means that our project is structured approximately like this:

```txt
redbox-copilot/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ workers/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ embed
â”‚     â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚     â”‚  â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ ingest
â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚        â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ legacy_app/
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ redbox/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Where the top level `pyproject.toml` is currently closely associated with `lagacy_app` and `redbox`.
